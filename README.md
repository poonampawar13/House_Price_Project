# House Price Prediction Project
This project aims to predict house prices using various features such as the area, number of rooms, neighborhood, and other factors. The dataset comes from Kaggle and includes numerous features that describe the house and its surroundings.

# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates house prices based on available features. This involves steps like data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

* Id: Unique identifier for each house.
* MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, etc. (list all features used).
  
The target variable is SalePrice, which represents the final price of each house.

# Project Workflow
1. Data Loading:
   * Read the dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   * Missing Value Handling: Impute missing values for continuous and categorical features using strategies like 'most frequent' and 'constant'.
   * Feature Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
   * Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features if needed.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   * Conduct a thorough EDA to understand feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.
   * Visualize important features with histograms, box plots, and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

4. Feature Selection:
   * Use methods such as Forward Selection and Backward Elimination with Linear Regression to choose the most relevant features for the model.

6. Modeling:
   * Perform a train-test split on the data.
   * Train models such as Ridge and Lasso Regression using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

7.Evaluation:
   * Evaluate the models using performance metrics such as:
     * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     * R² and Adjusted R² Scores
The evaluation metrics are used on both the training and testing datasets to assess model performance.

8. Prediction:
  * Apply the final model to predict house prices on the testing set and any new dataset.
